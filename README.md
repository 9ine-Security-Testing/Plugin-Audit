The `plugin.py`python script generates dependency files for multiple programming languages by categorising dependencies into Java, Node.js, Python, and .NET. The script takes predefined dependency lists and writes them into language-specific file formats:

> pom.xml for Java (Maven dependencies)

> package.json for Node.js

> requirements.txt for Python

> packages.config for .NET

Each dependency includes its name and version where applicable
